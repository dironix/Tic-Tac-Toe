# Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

This project is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It provides an interactive and engaging way to play the classic game directly in the browser.

## Features
- 🎮 Playable Tic-Tac-Toe board with smooth UI  
- 🖱️ Handles user clicks to place markers  
- 📊 Tracks game state and turns dynamically  
- 🏆 Checks for winning conditions after every move  
- 👥 Two modes:
  - Player vs Player
  - Player vs AI opponent  

## How to Play
1. Open the game in your browser.  
2. Players take turns placing their markers (❌ or ⭕) on the grid.  
3. The first player to align **three markers in a row** (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.  
4. If all cells are filled and no player wins, the game ends in a **draw**.  

## Tech Stack
- **HTML** – Structure of the game board  
- **CSS** – Styling for an engaging UI  
- **JavaScript** – Game logic, event handling, and AI functionality  

## Future Enhancements
- Add difficulty levels for AI (Easy, Medium, Hard)
